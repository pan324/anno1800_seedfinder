# Prepare the C calls.
# The Mersenne Twister uses the seed to create a state out of 624 ints.
# Then when we first want a random number, it creates a forward buffer of another 624 ints.
# The random numbers that we actually need is far lower.
# The typical large map uses just 70 RNG draws, including NPCs and pirates.
# Without them, just 56 RNG draws.
# So a large part of the buffer is wasted.
# => Modify the RNG so that it only creates the needed buffer.
#
# We can reuse the RNG state across old world and cape, because they both start from the seed again.
# But realistically, there is no need.
# In the old world, we get one good hit for every 2**14 = 16384 trials.
# Saving the RNG cannot improve the performance by even 0.01%.
#
# Selecting "random" for the maptype expands the pool of available maps.
# Without "random", the game randomly draws from a pool of exactly on possible map.
# With "random", the pool contains all maps.
# The RNG does nothing when there is only one choice, so "random" introduces an additional RNG draw.
# This shifts everything. The overall number of trials we could pull off is 20% larger for each maptype.
# Around 2.5B instead of 2.1B.
# But the normal seed range already has nice results, so no need to implement that.
#
# Another consideration is to buffer the cape results.
# The cape is the same regardless of all settings except island difficulty.
# The odds are only 2**6 = 64 however, which still leaves many seeds for the main world.
# The buffer would take about 2**25 * 4 bytes = 134 MB which is not an issue.
#
# Some islands are better than others and we actually need to quantify this.
# If given the choice between one large island without river and another large island with river,
# the river island might be preferable. No good data on that however.
#
# For now, instead of a scoring, define filtering, where each island either is allowed or not.
# When an island is selected but not allowed, we stop and try the next seed.
#
#
# NPCs only affect small islands (and not even all of them) and are ignored.
# Many of the checks for the islands can be preprocessed:
#   Island region
#   Diff
#   Gamemode
# which leaves only the id.
#
#
# Overall code flow (when maptype is not "random"):
#   Preprocess everything in Python for the desired template:
#     Slot data is used only as follows.
#       1) Get everything with slot.id==1
#       2) Get everything with slot.id==0 & slot.type==1
#       3) Grab islands that match slot.sz.
#       4) Choose islands that match slot.id.
#     We can calculate 1) and 2) beforehand.
#     3 works because sizes are mutually exclusive.
#     Step 4 seems hard to optimize.
#     It would nice to go from islands[slot.sz] to islands[slot.sz][slot.id],
#     but then one of these lists would be a subset of the other.
#     And the bookkeeping would also be trouble.
#
#     Island data needs:
#       1) Id, which is either 1 (normal island) or 3 (normal+starter island).
#       2) Is it unwanted.
#          This might become a quality score later on instead of just banning stuff.
#       3) Something to communicate river/non-river pairs.
#          Keep a byte that is either 1 (partner is one to the right)
#          or -1 (partner is one to the left) or 0 (no partner).
#       4) Has it been picked yet.
#          Instead of moving all data in the array after an island has been picked,
#          we just flag it and then skip on all iterations afterwards.
#
#   Now call multiple jobs in C, covering different parts of the seed range.
#   Each job takes all the needed data as well as a seed start and seed end.
#   It then runs along that range and returns a seed as soon as it finds one.
#   Python can then print/save the seed and restart the job from the current position as needed.
