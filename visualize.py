"""Draw a plot of the old world and cape at the same time.
The plot is divided in two parts:
    Old world on the left.
    Cape on the right.

Each of them has a different zoom level so that they fit into their half of the screen.
This means that on large old worlds, cape islands seem larger (because the map is zoomed in more).
